## TODO
* Fix bug in HousePagingSource which results in loading all house pages when we 
start to scroll on the house list and the view jumps. We can see it as a feature, 
as we then have all entries in the database and then the paging works perfectly 
* Add Refresh handling to invalidate cached data + use lastModified header
* Load characters from api with the provided urls in the e.g. overlord or heir members
* Add Toolbar
* Add sorting after region
* Add search
* Remember scroll position when going back from house detail to house list
* ...
